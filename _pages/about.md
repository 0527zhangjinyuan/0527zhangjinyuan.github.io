# About Me
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Finance Department at [INSEAD](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/academic-areas/finance). My research interests lie in the area of financial intermediation, including banking, pension funds, and mutual funds. I study the impact of macro-level policy on micro-level behaviors and the subsequent consequences of such behavioral changes on the real economy.

I am advised by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.insead.edu/joel-peress/home" target="_blank">Joel Peress</a>, Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/idrechsl/" target="_blank">Itamar Drechsler</a> ,  Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/johnkuongkcf/home" target="_blank">John Kuong</a>, and Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/guillaumevuillemey/home" target="_blank">Guillaume Vuillemey</a>.

I am on the job market and available for virtual interviews at the 2021 AEA/ASSA/AFA/EFA annual meetings.

<!-- 
I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Risk Management Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Master's Degree in Statistics at the University of British Columbia.
