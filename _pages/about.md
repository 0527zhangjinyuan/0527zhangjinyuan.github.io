# About Me
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Finance Department at [INSEAD](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/academic-areas/finance). My research interests lie in the general area of financial intermediation, including pension, banking, and mutual funds. I am keen to understand how macro-level environment/policies affect micro-level behaviors and what are subsequent consequences. 

I am advised by Prof. [Joel Peress](https://faculty.insead.edu/joel-peress/) (chair), [Itamar Drechsler](https://sites.google.com/site/idrechsl/) and [Guillaume Vuillemey](https://sites.google.com/site/idrechsl/). 


I am on the job market and will be available for interviews at the 2021 AFA meeting.

<!-- 
I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Risk Management Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Master's Degree in Statistics at the University of British Columbia.
