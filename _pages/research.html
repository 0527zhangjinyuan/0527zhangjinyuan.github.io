    [1]. <strong>Public Pension Deficits and Bank Deposits (Job Market Paper)</strong>

    <summary>Abstract: (click) </summary>
        This paper provides identified effects on public pension deficits on the real economy through households' capital allocations between bank deposits and capital market investment. I first show that higher pension deficits lead to more bank deposits and less capital market investments. I identify the causal impact of this effect by exploiting cross-sectional variations in U.S. state public pension deficits, and the quasi-exogenous shock of GASB rule changes. I then trace the impact of pension deficits on the real economy using staggered state pension reforms.  Pension reforms, which reduce pension deficits, induce households to withdrawal deposits. These household withdrawals significantly shrink banks' balance sheets. Consequently, banks with higher exposure to pension reforms lend less to small businesses. This lower lending is especially pronounced in non-pension-reforming states, which in turn leads to less new establishments and lower employment in these states. Overall, I show that pension reforms affect households' allocation decisions, which cause negative economic externalities in non-pension-reforming states.

            This paper examines the flow patterns in corporate bond mutual funds under different monetary policy environment. We build a model of runs in funds with uncertain future interest rate, uncovering a novel outflow-to-interest-rate relationship. Consistent with the model’s predictions, we empirically find that outflows from funds increases when the fed funds target rate increases, the outflow-to-rate sensitivity is stronger under more accommodative and uncertain monetary policy environment, and these monetary-policy-induced flow sensitivities are greater when bond market is more liquid. Our results suggest that fragility in corporate bond funds could be an important unintended consequence of monetary policy.

            Local demand for Bitcoin (BTC) increases around economic policy uncertainties. Countries see higher BTC premia over the USD price when experiencing surges in Economic Policy Uncertainties. These countries also witness larger turnovers of BTC trading and web traffic at the cryptocurrency exchanges. These finding are further supported by difference-in-difference tests exploiting episodes of Car Wash Operation, India Banknote Demonetization, and Impeachment of Park Geun-hye. The empirical pattern of flight to BTC is more prevalent in countries with lower levels of trust in governments, highlighting the stateless and unregulated nature of BTC as the qualifying feature of an alternative investment vehicle amid uncertainties.

            This paper develops a structural model to examine high-frequency price dynamics. The key innovation is to allow trades' permanent price impact to be time-varying—dynamic trade informativeness. A distribution-free filtering technique pins the real-world data to the model. The filtered series significantly recover the efficient price innovation through the dynamics of trade informativeness, improve trades' explanatory power for future returns, distinguish informativeness from trades' aggressiveness, gauge informed investors' patience, and capture systematic patterns around scheduled and unscheduled events, as well as general intraday trends. The framework contributes to the better utilization of high-frequency trading data.

      We provide a theoretical framework to understand the equilibrium consequences of common ownership. In the model, investors not only make information acquisition and portfolio allocation decisions,  but also affect the competition strategies of firms they own.
      We identify novel strategic complementarities among investors: A larger proportion of passive investors increases common ownership of competitive firms. As these passive owners optimally go against fierce competition, payoffs of competitive firms become less dispersed. This, in turn, reduces the ex-ante incentives to acquire information, resulting in more passive investors. This self-reinforcing mechanism can rationalize the large share of passive investment in the asset management industry. Moreover, we generate testable predictions on firms' return volatility and correlation to test whether passive investors indeed influence corporations' strategies.

    [6]. <strong>The Rise of Passive Funds Triggers Active Fund Consolidation</strong><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Summary: The rise of passive investing can trigger active funds to consolidate (T) </li>
    <li>Conferences: 2018 CICF, 2018 TADC</li>
    <li><details>
          <summary>Abstract: (click) </summary>
      Consolidation among active asset management funds surged in 2016. What triggered this new wave of consolidation? Using a noisy rational expectation model with imperfect competition, we show that the rise of passive investing can explain the new change. As the number of passive funds grows, the asset market becomes more liquid. As a result, the rents extracted from noise traders shrink and the competition among active funds becomes more intense. These effects squeeze down the expected profit margins of active funds, hence stimulating them to form a coalition to gain monopolistic trading power. I show that the rise of passive investing affects market outcomes (liquidity, price informativeness and volatility) through fund consolidation, and hence it is essential to control for active funds consolidation when examining the (casual) relationship between passive investing and market outcomes.
